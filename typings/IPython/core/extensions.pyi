class ExtensionManager(Configurable):
    """A class to manage IPython extensions.

    An IPython extension is an importable Python module that has
    a function with the signature::

        def load_ipython_extension(ipython):
            # Do things with ipython

    This function is called after your extension is imported and the
    currently active :class:`InteractiveShell` instance is passed as
    the only argument.  You can do anything you want with IPython at
    that point, including defining new magic and aliases, adding new
    components, etc.
    
    You can also optionally define an :func:`unload_ipython_extension(ipython)`
    function, which will be called if the user unloads or reloads the extension.
    The extension manager will only call :func:`load_ipython_extension` again
    if the extension is reloaded.

    You can put your extension modules anywhere you want, as long as
    they can be imported by Python's standard import mechanism.  However,
    to make it easy to write extensions, you can also put your extensions
    in ``os.path.join(self.ipython_dir, 'extensions')``.  This directory
    is added to ``sys.path`` automatically.
